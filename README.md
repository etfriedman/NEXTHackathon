you saved me a lot off annoying dict parsing


If you get an error regard NonType, make sure you are playing a song!!!! otherwise spotify drops your "currently playing" and we cant access it!
if you are getting a creds error (export=blahlbahlblah), run the lines in the creds.txt file 1 by 1 (make sure you have replced each item to your own)
